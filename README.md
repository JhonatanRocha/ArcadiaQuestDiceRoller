# Arcadia Quest Dice Roller

As an Arcadia Quest Lover, i built this app to improve the gameplay experience and reduce the playtime.
<br/>With this App, you will be able to simulate a complete battle, to simulate a combat,
<br/>just put your attack and the defense of your enemy target and let the App resolve.
<br/>After rolling the dices, just count the result compatible with your weapon and count the target defensive results.
<br/>The app supports rerolls, so you just have to mark whats your preference to reroll and the value and let the magic happens. 
<br/>Note that the app doesnt consider special abilities from the Itens or Heroes, you will have to do it on your own.
